# Simple-Ajax-Contact-Form-Using-jQuery-PHP

<li>creating a simple Ajax based Contact form using jQuery and PHP. </li>

<li> Why Ajax? because your visitors don’t have to reload the page in order to send you email, they can simply click send button and the email gets sent instantly before their eyes, so it’s just fantastic, no more page reloads! </li>

<li>  you should be able to pull it off if you are bit familiar with HTML, PHP and jQuery.</li>

<li> Have a look at the picture below, this is how our contact form going to look at the end.</li>

<li> We will have input fields as shown below, you can later add-remove other fields as per requirements of your HTML form.</li>


## Mark up

<li> Let’s start coding our contact page, we start by adding some input fields, you can review our code below. </li>

<li> A regular contact page contains name, email, phone and message fields, you may add other fields like check-boxes, radio buttons and select-boxes as per your requirements for the contact form. </li>


<li> If you look closely, you’ll realize that we didn’t wrap our fields with <FORM> tags here like in a typical HTML form. Since we are going to collect field values using jQuery .val(), we don’t really need a typical HTML form functionality here, all we need is some fields and a button to trigger jQuery code which will do the rest. </li>
